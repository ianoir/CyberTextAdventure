 In this game the player takes on the role of a hacker navigating through different servers on a network.
 Their goal is to locate a key file in a random system and return it to their home server.

 They do this by moving between servers and deleting the anti-virus programs they encounter.
 They can download files and store into memory slots to augment their stats (attack, health, defense).
